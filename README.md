 ## Agenda
This software is a tool for DJs and musicians, which is suitable for organising music and planning gigs. The main reason for implementing this programme is based on the following problem: 

In many cases, DJs create a "DJ Set" or "setlist" before a performance. This is a list of songs to be played at the gig. It contains information about the tempo, key and length of the song to ensure the best possible performance. Currently, this can be done with a text file or a handwritten note on paper. However, there are some problems in these cases:

- The representation of the DJ set is often unclear and inconsistent. Additionally to that, updating text files or handwritten notes can be quite time-consuming. 
- The length of a set has to be calculated by hand and is constantly changing if new songs are added or taken out.
