 ## Agenda
This software is a tool for DJs and musicians, which is suitable for organising music and planning gigs. The main reason for implementing this programme is based on the following problem: 

In many cases, DJs create a "DJ Set" or "setlist" before a performance. This is a list of songs to be played at the gig. It contains information about the tempo, key and length of the song to ensure the best possible performance. Currently, this can be done with a text file or a handwritten note on paper. However, there are some problems in these cases:

- The representation of the DJ set is often unclear and inconsistent. Additionally to that, updating text files or handwritten notes can be quite time-consuming. 
- The length of a set has to be calculated by hand and is constantly changing if new songs are added or taken out.
- During a performance, it is difficult to note the current progress in the DJ-Set. Either a mark in the text file or a pen on the handwritten note is necessary, which can be annoying.
- There is no guarantee that a music file for a particular song exists on the DJ's computer. So if he or she e.g. forgets to copy or download the file, a song may be planned in the DJ-Set  that is not available because it is stored on another computer. This can lead to very embarrassing moments on stage.
- The organisation of many setlists and the corresponding songs becomes increasingly difficult as the number of text files or handwritten notes grows.
